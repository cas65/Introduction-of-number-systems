# 1. Introduction to Number Systems

Computers process data using various number systems. The most common ones include:

## **Decimal (Base 10)**  
- **What it is**: The decimal system is the standard number system that humans use daily. It is a base 10 system, meaning it uses 10 digits: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.
- **Why it’s used**: The decimal system is natural for humans because we have 10 fingers, making counting in base 10 intuitive.
- **Position Value**: In the decimal system, the value of a digit depends on its position. For example, in the number `345`, the `5` is in the ones place, the `4` in the tens place, and the `3` in the hundreds place. Each place value is a power of 10.

**Example of Decimal Representation**:  
The number `345` can be broken down as:  
```plaintext
3 × 10² + 4 × 10¹ + 5 × 10⁰ = 300 + 40 + 5 = 345`
