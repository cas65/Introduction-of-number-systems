# 1. Introduction to Number Systems

Computers process data using various number systems. The most common ones include:

## **Decimal (Base 10)**  
- **What it is**: The decimal system is the number system we use every day. It’s a base 10 system, so it has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- **Why it’s used**:  Decimal makes sense to us because we have 10 fingers, so counting in base 10 just feels natural.
- **Position Value**: In the decimal system, the value of a digit depends on its position. For example, in the number 345, the 5 is in the ones place, the 4 in the tens place, and the 3 in the hundreds place. Each place value is a power of 10.

**Example of Decimal Representation**:  
The number 345 can be broken down as:  
3 × 10² + 4 × 10¹ + 5 × 10⁰ = 300 + 40 + 5 = 345 

## **Binary (Base 2)**
- **What it is**: The binary system is what most modern computers and digital systems use because it matches the ON/OFF states of electrical circuits: 0 (off) and 1 (on).
- **Why it’s used**: Binary works best because computers are built with circuits that have two states (on and off), which map perfectly to binary digits.
- **Position Value**: Position Value: In binary, each digit stands for a power of 2, starting from the right. For example, in the binary number 1011, the rightmost digit is 2⁰, the next is 2¹, then 2², and so on.
  
### Example of Binary Representation:
The binary number 1011 breaks down like this

1 × 2³ + 0 × 2² + 1 × 2¹ + 1 × 2⁰ = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11

## **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**
- **What it is**: The hexadecimal system is a base 16 system, using 16 symbols: 0-9 for values zero through nine, and A-F for values ten through fifteen.
- **Why it’s used**: Hexadecimal is easier to read and more compact than binary. Each hex digit represents four binary digits (a nibble), which makes it way more manageable when dealing with large binary numbers.
- **Position Value**: In hexadecimal, each digit represents a power of 16. For example, in the number 2F, the F represents 16⁰ and the 2 represents 16¹.

### Example of Hexadecimal Representation:
The hexadecimal number 2F can be converted to decimal as follows:

2 × 16¹ + F × 16⁰ = 32 + 15 = 47 (decimal)
