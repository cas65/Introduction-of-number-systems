# 1. Introduction to Number Systems

Computers process data using various number systems. The most common ones include:

## **Decimal (Base 10)**  
- **What it is**: The decimal system is the standard number system that humans use daily. It is a base 10 system, meaning it uses 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- **Why it’s used**: The decimal system is natural for humans because we have 10 fingers, making counting in base 10 intuitive.
- **Position Value**: In the decimal system, the value of a digit depends on its position. For example, in the number 345, the 5 is in the ones place, the 4 in the tens place, and the 3 in the hundreds place. Each place value is a power of 10.

**Example of Decimal Representation**:  
The number 345 can be broken down as:  
3 × 10² + 4 × 10¹ + 5 × 10⁰ = 300 + 40 + 5 = 345 

## Binary (Base 2)

### What it is:
The binary system is used internally by almost all modern computers and digital systems because it maps directly to the ON/OFF states of electrical circuits: 0 (off) and 1 (on).

### Why it’s used:
Binary is preferred because computers are built with circuits that have two states (on and off), which correspond directly to binary digits.

### Position Value:
In binary, each digit represents a power of 2, starting from the right. For example, in the binary number 1011, the rightmost digit represents 2⁰, the next represents 2¹, then 2², and so on.

### Example of Binary Representation:
The binary number 1011 is evaluated as:

1 × 2³ + 0 × 2² + 1 × 2¹ + 1 × 2⁰ = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 (decimal)

## Hexadecimal (Base 16)

### What it is:
The hexadecimal system is a base 16 system that uses 16 symbols: 0-9 for values zero through nine, and A-F for values ten through fifteen.

### Why it’s used:
Hexadecimal is used because it is more compact and easier to read than binary. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits (a nibble), which makes it more efficient for humans to work with large binary numbers.

### Position Value:
Each position in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16. For example, in the hexadecimal number 2F, the F represents 16⁰ and the 2 represents 16¹.

### Example of Hexadecimal Representation:
The hexadecimal number 2F can be converted to decimal as follows:

2 × 16¹ + F × 16⁰ = 32 + 15 = 47 (decimal)
